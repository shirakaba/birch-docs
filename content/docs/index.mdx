I'm Jamie Birch, and this is my personal docs site. The site exists to help me note down all the things I've learned over a decade working as a full-stack, multi-platform software engineer. I'm developing it in the open, on the off-chance that other developers may also benefit from the information.

Some links to my other stuff:

import { Rss } from "lucide-react";
import { SiGithub, SiX, SiSpeakerdeck } from "@icons-pack/react-simple-icons";
