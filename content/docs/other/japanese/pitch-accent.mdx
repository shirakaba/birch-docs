{/* TODO: Could revive my pitch accent [graphs](https://jp-pitch-accent.vercel.app). */}

Japanese is a tonal language, and mastering its tonality is key to pulling off an authentic native-like accent. Unfortunately, the system is complex, and resources for studying it are very limited.

In this article, I plan to share my own understanding based on studying Dogen's [phonetics course](https://www.patreon.com/cw/dogen), referring to the [NHK Pitch Accent dictionary](https://www.nhk.or.jp/bunken/accent/index.html) appendix and the primary data of the [Online Japanese Accent Dictionary](https://www.gavo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ojad/kouzokugo), and reading academic reviews such as Kawahara's [The Phonology of Japanese Accent](https://doi.org/10.1515/9781614511984.445).

<Callout type="warn">
  This page is going to take some time and several rewrites before it's worth
  reading, so consider it a scrappy work in progress for now. To see my full
  mental model of pitch accent so far, see the [CLI
  tool](https://github.com/shirakaba/pitch-accent) I created to work out pitch
  accent patterns for arbitrary words, which applies all the above resources.

# Nouns

## Non-compound nouns

### … with three syllables

Most likely, there will be an accent on the **first syllable**. However, there are some exceptions, particularly in words of native Japanese origin:

### … that are loanwords with four morae

Four-mora loanwords where the last two syllables are both **free of epenthetic vowels** and **light** are likely to be **unaccented**. To explain:

- Take the last two syllables of the word.
- Does either syllable include an epenthetic vowel?

  ```js
  const epentheticVowels = /[くすつぬむるずづぐクスツヌムルズヅグ]/g;

  // Each of these words include an epenthetic vowel in their last two syllables:
  // - "idol": ア・イ・ド・ル
  // - "process": プ・ロ・セ・ス
  epentheticVowels.test("ドル"); // true
  epentheticVowels.test("セス"); // true

  // Each of these words are free of epenthetic vowels in their last two syllables:
  // - "America": ア・メ・リ・カ
  // - "antenna": ア・ン・テ・ナ
  epentheticVowels.test("リカ"); // false
  epentheticVowels.test("テナ"); // false
  ```

  - **Yes**: The word will generally have an accent somewhere.
  - **No**: Is either syllable "heavy"?

    ```js
    const isHeavy = (morae: string[]) => morae.length > 1;

    // Each of these words include a heavy syllable in their last two syllables:
    // - "Parade": パ・レー・ド：HL
    // - "London": ロン・ドン：HH
    [["レ", "ー"], ["ド"]].some(isHeavy); // true
    [["ロ", "ン"], ["ド", "ン"]].some(isHeavy); // true

    // Each of these words are free of heavy syllables in their last two syllables:
    // - "America": ア・メ・リ・カ： LL
    // - "antenna": ア・ン・テ・ナ： LL
    [["リ"], ["カ"]].some(isHeavy); // false
    [["テ"], ["ナ"]].some(isHeavy); // false
    ```

    - **Yes**: The word will generally have an accent somewhere.
    - **No**: The word is likely to be unaccented! 🎉

## Compound nouns

### … formed from two nouns, N1 and N2

#### … where N2 has one or two morae

TODO: attack Kawahara's Section 4.1 with a strong coffee

#### … where N2 has three to four morae

If N2 is unaccented, or has accent on the final syllable, then the accent generally falls on the initial syllable of N2.

- si'n+yokohama → sin+yo'kohama "Shin-Yokohama"

_Source: [The Phonology of Japanese Accent](https://doi.org/10.1515/9781614511984.445), section 4.2:23_

Otherwise, the accent of N2 is retained:

- si'n+tamane'gi → sin+tamane'gi "new onion"

_Source: [The Phonology of Japanese Accent](https://doi.org/10.1515/9781614511984.445), section 4.2:24_

#### … where N2 has five or more morae

The compound noun tends to retain the accent of the N2.
