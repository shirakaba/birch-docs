{/* TODO: Could revive my pitch accent [graphs](https://jp-pitch-accent.vercel.app). */}

Japanese is a tonal language, and mastering its tonality is key to pulling off an authentic accent. Unfortunately, the system is complex and resources for studying it are very limited.

In this article, I plan to share my own understanding based on studying Dogen's [phonetics course](https://www.patreon.com/cw/dogen), referring to the [NHK Pitch Accent dictionary](https://www.nhk.or.jp/bunken/accent/index.html) appendix and the primary data of the [Online Japanese Accent Dictionary](https://www.gavo.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ojad/kouzokugo), and reading academic reviews such as Kawahara's [The Phonology of Japanese Accent](https://doi.org/10.1515/9781614511984.445). I used all of these sources to develop a [CLI tool](https://github.com/shirakaba/pitch-accent) to work out pitch accent patterns for arbitrary words.

ðŸš§ Work in progress.
