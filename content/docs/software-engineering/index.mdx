description: Hard-learned lessons on the craft of software development.

I've worked in various different settings:

- as a solo dev
- as a subcontractor
- in small teams
- under or alongside experienced devs
- in leadership roles
- in harmonious environments
- in challenging environments

In each case, there were valuable lessons to be learned, and no matter how rough the seas were, there was some way to influence the path the ship took through the storm for the better.
