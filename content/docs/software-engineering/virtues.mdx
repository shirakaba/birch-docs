# Unblock your teammates

It's a major productivity killer to be blocked on someone else, but bear in mind that **it goes both ways**. If you lead a good example for others, you create an environment that will encourage others to do the same for you in return. So jump on those PR reviews, provision that infrastructure, send out those invites, and prioritise your team above yourself.

Be careful not to **take it to the extreme**, though. The worst-case scenario is that you spend all day unblocking everyone else and never get any of your own work done. All the more tragic if they get recognised for their swift productivity this quarter whilst you get overlooked despite having facilitated it all.

The middle ground is to **set expectations**. Be predictable in how much time you can offer each day (e.g. one review in the morning, another in the afternoon). Weigh up the importance of a request against your own deliverables. Block out time to guarantee your own work.

But above all, **communicate your needs**. Sometimes, you'll have a task that requires prolonged concentration, or you'll be in a situation where context-switching is expensive. Consider your own limitations and be prepared to decline requests. Just give a heads-up whenever possible, so that the team can adjust accordingly.
