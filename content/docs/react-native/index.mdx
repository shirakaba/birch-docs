title: React Native
---

[React Native](https://reactnative.dev) is a cross-platform framework for developing native apps using [React](https://react.dev). While the officially supported platforms are iOS and Android, it is also possible to use React Native to build for [Web](https://github.com/facebook/react-strict-dom), [Apple TV and Android TV](https://github.com/react-native-tvos/react-native-tvos), [macOS](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-macos), [Windows](https://github.com/microsoft/react-native-windows), and [various other](https://reactnative.dev/docs/out-of-tree-platforms) platforms.

Nowadays, it is officially recommended to use React Native via a framework, such as [Expo](https://expo.dev) or [Rock](https://www.rockjs.dev), which wraps around it (both the library itself and its tooling such as the CLI and bundler).
