## Built-in profiling

Xcode has built-in profiling tools described thoroughly in this [blog post](https://www.avanderlee.com/optimization/analysing-build-performance-xcode/). They give a profile like this:

While these tools are fine for measuring the length of individual tasks, they're a bit hard to use for visualising blockers in the build. If I want that, I turn to community-made tools.
