## Via the VS Code UI

Despite hours of trying, I have never, _ever_ managed to get this working through any means. So sadly, it's CLI all the way, in my eyes.

## Via the CLI

Add `gem 'debug'` to your `Gemfile` and run `bundle install`.

Now, you can run Ruby scripts through the [Ruby Debugger](https://github.com/ruby/debug) (`rdbg`) as follows:

```sh
# To debug `FOO=BAR bundle exec fastlane release`:
FOO=BAR bundle exec rdbg -c -- bundle exec fastlane release
```

Useful commands:

- `n` / `next`: Next line.
- `c` / `continue`: Continue.
- `bt`: Backtrace.
- `i` / `info`: Info.
- `h` / `help`: Help.
- `p my_variable`: Evaluate the expression `my_variable`.

The Ruby Debugger will automatically stop at `debugger` / `binding.break` / `binding.b` statements. In practice, I find it easiest to navigate just by inserting those into the code and playing through with `continue`.
